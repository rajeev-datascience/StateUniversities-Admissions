# StateUniversity Admissions - Applications Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project analyzes student admissions across **State Universities in the U.S.**, focusing on **total applications, grants, and fund allocations**. Using Power BI, we built an interactive dashboard to help policymakers and universities **track applications trends, identify top & bottom universities, and analyze fund distributions**.

## Dataset & Key Metrics
- **Datasets Used:**
  - `University Admissions_New.xlsx`
  - `University Applications Charter.xlsx`
- **Key Metrics Analyzed:**
  - Total Applications
  - Target Applications per State
  - % of Applications by Race
  - Special Grants & Fund Allocations
  - Top & Bottom Universities by Applications

## Dashboard Components
1. **Total Applications vs. Target Trend by State** 📊
2. **Total Applications by State - Geo Dashboard** 🌎
3. **Tabular Presentation of Universities & Funds** 🏛️
4. **% of Applications by Race** 📈
5. **Top 10 Universities by Applications** 🎓
6. **Top 10 Universities by Applications (With & Without Grants)** 💰
7. **Bottom 10 Universities by Applications** 📉
8. **% of Applications vs. Universities Fund Allocations** 🔄

## Insights & Key Findings
🔹 **State-Level Trends:** States with higher education funding showed a direct correlation with higher applications.
🔹 **Diversity in Admissions:** % of applications by race revealed certain states had **lower diversity in enrollments**, which could impact policy decisions.
🔹 **Grant Impact Analysis:** Universities receiving special grants didn’t always have the highest application rates—indicating a need for **better fund allocation strategies**.
🔹 **Top vs. Bottom Universities:** The gap between the **top 10 and bottom 10 universities** was significant in applications, indicating disparities in reputation or funding.
